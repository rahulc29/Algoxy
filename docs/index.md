# About {-}

Solutions to the text ["Elementary Algorithms"](https://github.com/liuxinyu95/AlgoXY). 

For fun, non-serious learning project.

The text is particularly cool because it uses both functional and imperative techniques. I've been wanting to get better at FP for a while - so why not actually _do something_ in it?

Other options include using Elm for building an HTML UI (not particularly interesting if you don't already have a good idea), using F# and Suave to build servers on ASP.NET (requires more knowledge of Kleisli categories and monads than I currently possess), or write a small computer algebra system (something I plan on doing _eventually_).

Studying a few standard data structures is a particularly good option then.

Solutions are available online on [my Github pages](https://rahulc29.github.io/Algoxy/).
